                It is with thanks to the Almighty that I welcome myself into the second
                and last week of CSS skilling. It has been difficult but interesting as
                I dive deeper into website development.

                The main goal is to become a world-class full-stack developer. With
                commitment and determination, success will be mine.

            <h2>Never Give Up</h2>
            <p>
                The biggest lesson from my journey at PLP Academy is
                <b><i>"Never give up"</i></b>. Challenges may come, but solutions always
                appear.

            <p>
                Flexbox, responsive design, and grid layouts were taught, but I still
                struggle with fully understanding them. They are powerful and essential
                tools for web development.

                I have put in a lot of effort into completing week four. I'm still
                behind, but I believe I will eventually master everything.
